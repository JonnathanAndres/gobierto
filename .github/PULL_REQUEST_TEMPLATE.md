Closes #N

### What does this PR do?



### How should this be manually tested?



### Does this PR changes any configuration file?

- [ ] new environment variable in `.env.example`?
- [ ] new entry in `config/application.yml`?
- [ ] new entry in `config/secrets.yml`?

(Changes in these files might need to update the role in Ansible)
